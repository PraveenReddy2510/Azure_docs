In this module, you’ll be introduced to general cloud concepts. You’ll start with an introduction to the cloud in general. Then you'll dive into concepts like shared responsibility, different cloud models, and explore the unique pricing method for the cloud.
If you’re already familiar with cloud computing, this module may be largely review for you.
Learning objectives
After completing this module, you’ll be able to:
•	Define cloud computing.
•	Describe the shared responsibility model.
•	Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
•	Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
•	Describe the consumption-based model.
•	Compare cloud pricing models.
What is cloud computing
Completed100 XP
•	3 minutes
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).
Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.
This short video provides a quick introduction to cloud computing.
